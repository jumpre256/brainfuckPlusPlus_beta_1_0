## Brainfuck++

Is put on a github directly from being an intelliJ project. But it is very easy to grab the source java code files from the 'src' folder and compile and run, the java files without intelliJ. <br>
Many TODOs, namely;

-> provide easier compiling and executing support for new users. <br>
-> provide instructions here on how to use the software. <br>


Plan to improve the front-end user interface of this software with a deadline of 12th February 2024; <br>

About: <br>
Brainfuck++ adds a few "quality of life" additions to the original brainfuck language whilst keeping in the spirit of its esoteric, hardcore nature. <br>
Designed for building bigger projects in the future in a brainfuck-esque language for the memes. Goal is to one day make a brainfuck++ powered operating system.
Implemented in Java, goal is to hide this implementation detail more in the future.
